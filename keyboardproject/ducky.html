            <h1>Ducky One 3 Keyboard</h1>
    
            <p>The One 3 Mini is, like all Ducky boards that aren't part of the Mecha line, made out of plastic. That's excusable if you look at what you're getting for the price that Ducky is asking for, and also because it doesn't feel super cheap or anything like that. It does flex a little bit when I hold it in both hands and apply pressure, but there's absolutely no creaking or flexing when I'm using it in a regular way where it's just sitting on my desk/deskpad so I have no complaints about the build quality of the One 3 Mini.As I've come to expect from Ducky the RGB is also fantastic. There's a white backplate here, and that really allows the colors to bounce off of it nicely. One thing to note is that the keycaps are not shine through this time around, leading to an overall less impressive RGB show when compared to caps that do allow light to shine through their legends. The board uses a standard bottom row though, so swapping out these caps should be a breeze if you're looking for more on the RGB front. I myself quite like the fact that they've gone for solid legends as opposed to shine through legends as I usually don't turn on RGB effects unless I'm going to be gaming for the night, so I vastly prefer solid caps as those simply look better with the RGB turned off.</p>
