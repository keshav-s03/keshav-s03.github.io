            <p>As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” We all have emotions, feelings, thoughts and moods that may influence our mental health, and that is perfectly normal.Mental health encompasses our overall functioning and psychological well-being, including our ability to cope with positive and negative emotions. It also includes how we create and manage relationships, says Stan. “Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has physical health,” Stan says.</p>

            <h3>What is Mental Health</h3>

            <img class="img-1" src="https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mental-health.jpg?fit=2121%2C1414&ssl=1" width="500" height="300" alt="Workers" >

            <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

            <h3>What causes Mental Health Problems</h3>
            <p>Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one's death or a divorce. An ongoing (chronic) medical condition, such as diabetes. Brain damage as a result of a serious injury (traumatic brain injury), such as a violent blow to the head. Traumatic experiences, such as military combat or assault.</p>

                <p>Nurturing our mental health can also help us combat or prevent the mental health problems that are sometimes associated with a chronic physical illness. In some cases, it can prevent the onset or relapse of a physical or mental illness. Managing stress well, for instance, can have a positive impact on heart disease.

                    <h3>What is Social Stigma</h3>
                    <p>Social stigma is the disapproval of, or discrimination against, an individual or group based on perceivable social characteristics that serve to distinguish them from other members of a society.</p>

                    <img class="img-1" src="https://www.bhthechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/stigma.jpg" width="700" height="500"  alt="Stigma">

                    <h3>What is Mental Health Stigma</h3>
                    <p>Mental health stigma refers to societal disapproval, or when society places shame on people who live with a mental illness or seek help for emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, or PTSD.
                        
                        Stigma is when someone views you in a negative way because you have a distinguishing characteristic or personal trait that's thought to be, or actually is, a disadvantage (a negative stereotype). Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common.

                        Stigma can lead to discrimination. Discrimination may be obvious and direct, such as someone making a negative remark about your mental illness or your treatment. Or it may be unintentional or subtle, such as someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. You may even judge yourself.

                    <h3>Different Ways to Cope With Stigma</h3>
                    <p>Here Are Some Different Ways to Treat Stigma</p>

                    <div class="container-2">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get treatment. You may be reluctant to admit you need treatment. Don't let the fear of being labeled with a mental illness preveyou from seeking help. Treatment can provide relief by identifying what's wrong and reducing symptoms that interfere with your work apersonal life.</li>
            
            <li>Don't let stigma create self-doubt and shame. Stigma doesn't just come from others. You may mistakenly believe that your conditiis a sign of personal weakness or that you should be able to control it without help. Seeking counseling, educating yourself about yocondition and connecting with others who have mental illness can help you gain self-esteem and overcome destructive self-judgment.</li></ul>
            
            <li>Don't isolate yourself. If you have a mental illness, you may be reluctant to tell anyone about it. Your family, friends, clergy members of your community can offer you support if they know about your mental illness. Reach out to people you trust for tcompassion, support and understanding you need.</li>
            
            <li>Don't equate yourself with your illness. You are not an illness. So instead of saying "I'm bipolar," say "I have bipolar disorderInstead of calling yourself "a schizophrenic," say "I have schizophrenia."</li>
             
            <li>Join a support group. Some local and national groups, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), offer local prograand internet resources that help reduce stigma by educating people who have mental illness, their families and the general public. Sostate and federal agencies and programs, such as those that focus on vocational rehabilitation and the Department of Veterans Affai(VA), offer support for people with mental illness.</li>
    
            <li>Get help at school. If you or your child has a mental illness that affects learning, find out what plans and programs might helDiscrimination against students because of a mental illness is against the law, and educators at primary, secondary and college leveare required to accommodate students as best they can. Talk to teachers, professors or administrators about the best approach aresources. If a teacher doesn't know about a student's disability, it can lead to discrimination, barriers to learning and poor grades</li>
            
            <li>Speak out against stigma. Consider expressing your opinions at events, in letters to the editor or on the internet. It can heinstill courage in others facing similar challenges and educate the public about mental illness.</li>

        <h3>How Does Drugs & Alcohol Affect Your Mental Health</h3>
        <img class="img-1"  src="https://www.kenoshachc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1-drugs-300x300.jpg" width="200" alt="Image 1">
        <p>Chronic use of some drugs (including alcohol) can lead to both short- and long-term changes in the brain, which can lead to mental health issues including paranoia, depression, anxiety, aggression, hallucinations, and other problems. </p>

        <img class="img-1" src="https://www.kenoshachc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-alcohol-300x300.jpg" width="200" alt="Image 2">
        <h3>Some Ways Drugs and Alcohol Impact the Brain</h3>
        <p>The brain is the most complex of all body organs. It regulates and coordinates every single process in your body through a communication system in which neurons pass messages back and forth among different structures within your brain and other parts of your body. What drugs do is they interfere with the way neurons normally send, receive, and process information. Depending on the type of drug, it affects a different part of the brain. And though you might feel momentary pleasure, the side effects can be permanent. Some of these effects include impaired learning and cognitive function, memory loss, lack of self-control, among others.Just like drugs, alcohol disrupts your brain’s communication system. While alcohol can initially make you feel energized, happy and inhibited, it actually works as a nervous system depressant, which you can witness when after a few drinks, you start having trouble coordinating your movements and speaking fluently. Alcohol abuse has long-term effects on both your physical and mental health such as liver damage, cancer, cognitive impairment, memory loss, psychosis, anxiety, and depression.</p>

        <h3>Some Ways Drugs and Alcohol Impact the Brains Memory</h3>
        <p>Sometimes when you drink too much, the next day, you have trouble remembering some parts of the night. People might even tell you what you said or did, and you still have no recollection whatsoever of these events. These “blackouts”, as they are often referred to, are an indication that you are drinking too much—and though experiencing one doesn’t mean that your brain cells associated with memory are damaged, frequent heavy drinking can actually damage your memory cells permanently.</p>

        <p>
        Suicide is one of the toughest tragedies students, staff, and the school system has to face. According to the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for youth 15-24 years of age and the 3rd leading cause for 10-14 year olds in theUnited States. On average, two Wake County students every year die by suicide. It has a lingering effect on a community. Just like it takes avillage to raise a child, all of us have a role in trying to protect our students, our children.
            
        Trained school staff work daily to prevent suicide by identifying and assisting students who show warning signs or risk factors, which caninclude depression, mental health concerns, or thoughts of suicide. WCPSS professionals screen identified students, notify parents/guardians,and connect them with community services when appropriate to address their needs. We watch, we listen, we understand, and we do it withoutjudgement. We never want suicide to be the solution to a student’s problems.
            
        National mental health experts created this list of youth suicide warning signs. Read it. Recognize the red flags. Know what to do.
            
        </p>

        <h3>Youth Sucide Warning </h3>

        <div class="container-2">
            <ul>
                <li>Talking about or making plans for suicide</li> 
                <li>Expressing hopelessness about the future</li> 
                <li>Displaying severe/overwhelming emotional pain or distress</li> 
                <li>Showing worrisome behavioral cues or marked changes in behavior, particularly in the presence of the warning signs above.</li> 
                <li>The withdrawl from or changing in social connections/situations</li>
                <li>Changes in sleep (increased or decreased)</li>
                <li>Anger or hostility that seems out of character or out of context</li> 
                <li>Recent increased agitation or irritability</li> 
            </ul>
        </div>




            <p>Don’t think it can’t happen to you. More than one in 10 high school students have attempted to die by suicide. Don’t try to fix the problem on your own. Get expert help through a teacher, a counselor, or a medical or mental health professional. Please contact your child’s school and ask for assistance. If your needs are immediate, contact 911.

                We don’t want to lose any students to suicide. We all need to work together and pay attention to our children, in the hopes of helping them and keeping them safe.
