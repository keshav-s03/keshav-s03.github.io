        <h1>Minecraft Biomes</h1>

        <p>A biome is a region in a world with distinct geographical features, flora, temperatures, humidity ratings, and sky, water, grass and foliage colors. Biomes separate every generated world into different environments, such as forests, deserts and taigas. But in Minecraft</p>

                    <p>Plains are a common biome, usually treeless. They spawn many passive mobs such as pigs, cows, sheep, and horses. They usually border forests. Sunflower plains are the only biome where you can find sunflowers.

                    <h3>Minecraft Jungle Biome</h3>
                    <p>Jungles are mostly heavily forested, rivaling the dark forests in tree density. Unlike the short and thick trees of the dark forest, jungle trees can grow tall, and are the tallest trees in the game, with the tallest of them being well over 30 blocks in height. Large and balloon oak trees may also grow within the tall jungle trees, and "bushes" made of oak leaves‌[Java Edition only][1] or jungle leaves and a single log‌[Bedrock Edition only] grow on the floor of the jungle, which frequently obstruct view of the bright green grass below. Many of the leaves and logs of both types are covered in vines. Jungles contain varying terrain, from the typical dense foliage of the main jungle biomes to the grassy meadows that form in jungle edge biomes.

                    <h3>Minecraft Desert Biome</h3>
                    <p>In the daytime, desert biomes are almost completely devoid of passive mobs Rabbits excluded. However, hostile mobs will spawn at night, as in other biomes. The desert is a bare, almost inhospitable environment. The few features found here are: Cacti, rabbits, dead bushes, Desert Temples, and the occasional Village. Another rare structure found in the desert biome is a desert well, which currently serves no purpose other than an infinite water supply. Like forest biomes, desert biomes have scattered mountains and cliffs, but desert biomes generate with basins more frequently. Desert biomes are a good source for Sugar Cane. Although it is commonly believed that deserts do not have water or very little, small ponds appear quite frequently in deserts. However, after the Minecraft 1.6, desert pools of water were removed the lava pools stayed, allowing only rivers to pass through. Most desert biomes have jungles near them. It is very rare for a desert to generate next to a biome with a totally different climate; for example, a desert biome and an Ice Spikes biome next to each other.</p>

                    <p>The ocean also known as the sea is one of the largest biomes in Minecraft, as around 60% of the Overworld is covered in ocean. There are many types of oceans such as warm and lukewarm oceans.

                    <h3>Minecraft Tiaga Biome</h3>
                    <p>Taiga biomes combine jungle and forest biomes. They typically have spruce trees and ferns. Taigas can contain wolves, foxes, sweet berry bushes, villages, pillager outposts, and more. The giant tree taiga variation of the taiga biome contains much larger spruce trees and podzol on the ground.</p>
